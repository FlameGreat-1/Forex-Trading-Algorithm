    "   - For large datasets, memory usage could be a concern. Consider implementing\n",
    "     memory-efficient data processing techniques.\n",
    "   - The parallel execution in run_analysis could be optimized to better handle\n",
    "     API rate limits and resource constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Error Handling and Logging:\n",
    "   - Implement more robust error handling throughout the code, especially for API\n",
    "     calls and data processing steps.\n",
    "   - Enhance logging to provide detailed information about each step of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model Validation and Backtesting:\n",
    "   - Implement a backtesting framework to validate the effectiveness of the\n",
    "     macroeconomic analysis in predicting asset price movements.\n",
    "   - Consider adding cross-validation techniques for the statistical models used.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Extensibility:\n",
    "   - Design the system to easily incorporate new data sources or analytical techniques.\n",
    "   - Consider implementing a plugin architecture for adding new indicators or analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Visualization and Reporting:\n",
    "   - Enhance the report generation to include interactive visualizations.\n",
    "   - Consider implementing a dashboard for real-time monitoring of key indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Security:\n",
    "   - Implement secure handling of API keys, possibly using environment variables\n",
    "     or a dedicated secrets management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Data Update Mechanism:\n",
    "   - Implement a mechanism to regularly update the data and rerun the analysis\n",
    "     to capture the latest market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Interpretability:\n",
    "    - Enhance the reporting to provide clear interpretations of the analysis results,\n",

    "reports, it offers valuable insights for financial decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that economic analysis is complex and subject to\n",
    "many external factors. This system should be used as one tool among many in a\n",
